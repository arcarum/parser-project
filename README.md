# Parser for Assignment Statements
This repository contains a parser implemented in Python for processing simple assignment statements. The parser consists of two main components: a lexical analyzer and a syntax analyzer.

# Lexical Analyzer
The lexical analyzer is responsible for breaking down input sentences into tokens. It identifies various elements, such as letters, digits, operators, and special characters. The recognized tokens are defined in the Token enumeration.

# Syntax Analyzer
The syntax analyzer is designed to validate the structure of assignment statements. It uses the tokens and lexemes generated by the lexical analyzer to enforce the correct syntax. The parser verifies that the input conforms to the grammar rules for assignment statements. If the input is invalid it highlights the errors with appropriate error messages.

# Language Rules
`<assignment-statement> -> <identifier> = (<identifier> | <numerical-literal>) {<operator> (<identifier> | <numerical-literal>)}`

`<identifier> -> <letter> {<letter> | <digit>}`

`<numerical-literal> -> [+|-] <digit> {<digit>} [. <digit> {<digit>}]`

`<operator> -> + | - | * | / | %`

# Usage
1) Ensure that there are sequentially numbered text files named '1', '2', and so on, present in the same directory as the `parser.py`. The text files should contain the sentences to be parsed, there can be more than one sentence in each file.
2) Run `parser.py`
3) `parser_output.txt` will be generated and will contain the error details
